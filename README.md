# Lab2-Machine-Learning-Programming-PROG8245-# Jewelry Sales Data Engineering Lab

The project applies an artificial jewelry e-commerce data set to construct a whole data engineering pipeline. We saw that Python and object-oriented strategies are applied to loading, profiling, cleaning, transforming and serializing data.

Quick-start: 

python -m venv venv, pip install -r requirements.txt, jupyter notebook
